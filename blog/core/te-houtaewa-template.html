    <h1>The Story of Te Houtaewa (PAGE heading)</h1>
    <h2>E kore e mau i a koe, he wae kai pakiaka. <em>A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest runner.</em> (Optional SUB title) </h2>
    <h3>10 November 2010</h3>
    
    <p>
      Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.

      <h2>Simply put</h2>
      
      <p>I have become a lover of simplicity in the past year. Most of my understanding of the world so far has been very complicated, mentally and emotionally exhausting, and held together by language and ideas moulded by times other than these; they failed to prepare me to relate to reality as it unfolded before me at times. There has been a scabbing-over of my sense of identity and my personal values, while my strengths have been so challenged and taxed that I wonder if they’re there anymore. The peeling-off of these scabs is just now beginning, and this might be a good exercise to help the process along. </p><br>
      <p>So I love simplicity, because it allows for truth and beauty to arise, for things to be as they are. Since early in life I’ve been dumbfounded by how everyone around me found various painful ways to distract themselves from the beauty and perfection of who they are and the love surrounding their lives, and then I found myself doing the same. But turning my attention towards the simple things of child-like existence, a hug, rolling around in the dirt, playing in the rain… none of them require much effort, thinking or anything at all, but how wonderful all these things are!</p><br>
      <p>On a different level, this same sense of joy comes to me when freedom is in the air. And this has meant several different things at various stages of my life. Today freedom feels like the ability to choose who I am at every moment, without personal, familial, cultural or any kind of conditioning; not changing to hide who I am, but to better express and embody it. This comes from within, from a relationship with myself, an understanding of my true will and what drives me; losing that severs my ability to remain free. I don’t feel the need to free myself from external structures and groups or to determine other people’s behaviours to stop them from limiting my freedom.</p><br>
      <p>The way I see these principles expressed in my life is through honesty. Since childhood honesty has been present in every part of my life, I couldn’t tell a lie to save my life. That changed with time, when truth was something that wasn’t allowed in the space where I was, until one day I decided never to tell a lie again, no matter the consequences. That is a bold claim, and a tall order, no doubt, but I would not choose a different path up the mountain. Following those words has brought me freedom from lies, deception, manipulation and all the funk that comes with them. My life is much more simple, since I have no land-mines to navigate that could reveal something I’m hiding from the world; I can simply be honest and deal with things as they are.</p><br>
      <p>Very nice and all, but where’s the proof?!</p><br>
      <p>I made a very difficult choice earlier this year. For a long time I have had a dream, and it has shaped all the decisions I made in the past three years. I wanted to grow cannabis legally, naturally, here in Te Tairāwhiti. I had a chance to do just that, and took it, even though it changed everything in every aspect of my life. I staked everything on it; my partnership with my wife, my relationships with my friends and family, my livelihood, everything. It was the hardest thing I have ever done, and I did it for far longer than I believed I could.</p><br>
      <p>The whole time, my will was divided between my personal dream and the connections that nurtured and supported me to be who I am. I was seeing myself getting lost in a life that was not my own, where my sense of identity was being constantly shut down and rejected, barely keeping in touch with the ground that held me up; I had to make a choice. Being honest with myself and remaining true to my principles, I had to let go of the one thing that was complicating and distorting the reality around me; my intention to remain feeding that dream even though it was costing me everything. So I collected my things and went back home, where I started to make peace with my choices, repair my relationships with everyone that I had left behind, including myself, and ask the question of who I am, and what I do, all over again.</p><br>
      <p>The truth is, it was all worth it, it was a great adventure, and one more chapter in a book full of empty pages moving forward.</p><br>
