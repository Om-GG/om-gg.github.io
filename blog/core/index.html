      <h1>Core</h1>
      <p><strong>Simply put</strong></p><br>
      <p>I have become a lover of simplicity in the past year. Most of my understanding of the world so far has been very complicated,
         mentally and emotionally exhausting, and held together by language and ideas moulded by times other than these;
          they failed to prepare me to relate to reality as it unfolded before me at times. 
          There has been a scabbing-over of my sense of identity and my personal values, 
          while my strengths have been so challenged and taxed that I wonder if they’re there anymore. The peeling-off of these scabs is just now beginning, and this might be a good exercise to help the process along. </p><br>

      <h1><strong>Learning Plan</strong></h1>
      <h2><strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?
      </strong></h2><br>
      <p>I want to be part of a great team. In the past I’ve found that the times I have learned the most and felt happiest while at work was when I was part of a caring, motivated and supportive team, where we could rely on each other to get everything done and feel good about ourselves at the end of the day. I have many passions and avenues I would like to explore in the tech world, from AI and machine learning, to videogames and online learning platforms. There are many things I would love to learn to do, but doing them with a great team would make all the difference in the world.</p><br>
