      <p>I have become a lover of simplicity in the past year. Most of my understanding of the world so far has been very complicated, mentally and emotionally exhausting, and held together by language and ideas moulded by times other than these; they failed to prepare me to relate to reality as it unfolded before me at times. There has been a scabbing-over of my sense of identity and my personal values, while my strengths have been so challenged and taxed that I wonder if theyâ€™re there anymore. The peeling-off of these scabs is just now beginning, and this might be a good exercise to help the process along. </p><br>
