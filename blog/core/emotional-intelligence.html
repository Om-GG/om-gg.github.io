      <h1><strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong></h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Emotional intellighes is the ability any of us has to recognise, understand, and manage their own emotions or
        those of others.
        It is a skill set that we cultivate from early in our lives and helps us incrementally improve our
        decision-making, communication
        and ability to build and maintain relationships. It was proposed to have 5 main components, by Daniel Goleman,
        who first introduced
        the term in the mid-1990s as part of his work as a psychologist and science journalist. The five components are
        self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. <br /><br />

        Self-awareness is to the ability to recognize and understand one's own emotions and how they
        influence thoughts and behaviors. For example, if you are feeling stressed and anxious, you may become more
        irritable and short-tempered. By being aware of this, you can take steps to manage your stress and avoid lashing
        out at others.<br /><br />

        Self-regulation is the ability to manage and control one's own emotions. For example, if you are feeling angry,
        you can use techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness to calm yourself
        down.<br /><br />

        Motivation is the ability to use emotions to drive behavior and achieve goals. For example, when feeling
        inspired and motivated, you may be more likely to work on a creative project or pursue a new goal.<br /><br />

        Empathy is the ability to understand and respond to the emotions of others. For example, if a friend is going
        through a difficult time, you may be able to sense their sadness and respond with comfort and
        support. Empathy is sometimes divided into two different types of empathy: cognitive empathy and emotional
        empathy. Cognitive empathy refers to the ability to understand other people's perspectives and emotions without
        necessarily feeling them yourself. Emotional empathy refers to the ability to feel what other people are
        feeling.<br /><br />

        Social skills are the ability to build and maintain relationships with others. For example, if you are able to
        effectively communicate and collaborate with your colleagues, you may be more successful in your work
        environment.<br /><br />
