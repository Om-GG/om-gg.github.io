          <h1><strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong></h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence is the ability any of us has to recognise, understand, and manage their own emotions or
            those of others.
            It is a skill set that we cultivate from early in our lives and helps us incrementally improve our
            decision-making, communication
            and ability to build and maintain relationships. It was proposed to have 5 main components, by Daniel Goleman,
            who first introduced
            the term in the mid-1990s as part of his work as a psychologist and science journalist. The five components are
            self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. <br /><br />

            Self-awareness is to the ability to recognize and understand one's own emotions and how they
            influence thoughts and behaviors. For example, if we are feeling stressed and anxious, we may become more
            irritable and short-tempered. By being aware of this, we can take steps to manage our stress and avoid lashing
            out at others.<br /><br />

            Self-regulation is the ability to manage and control one's own emotions. For example, if we are feeling angry,
            we can use techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness to calm ourselves
            down.<br /><br />

            Motivation is the ability to use emotions to drive behavior and achieve goals. For example, when feeling
            inspired and motivated, we may be more likely to work on a creative project or pursue a new goal.<br /><br />

            Empathy is the ability to understand and respond to the emotions of others. For example, if a friend is going
            through a difficult time, we may be able to sense their sadness and respond with comfort and
            support. Empathy is sometimes divided into two different types of empathy: cognitive empathy and emotional
            empathy. Cognitive empathy refers to the ability to understand other people's perspectives and emotions without
            necessarily feeling them ourselves. Emotional empathy refers to the ability to feel what other people are
            feeling.<br /><br />

            Social skills are the ability to build and maintain relationships with others. For example, if we are able to
            effectively communicate and collaborate with our colleagues, we may be more successful in our work
            environment.<br /><br />
            
            The difference between emotional intelligence and IQ may seem like something obvious, after reading the above, but
            let us take a moment to reflect on this. IQ mainly refers to the ability a person has to process, retain and use 
            infrometion in their (mostly mental) field of awarenes in order to solve problems to a level of complexity using tools
            like visual and spatial processing, knowledge of the world, fluid reasoning, working and shor-term memory and quantitative
            reasoning. A keen eye can see how both frameworks operate in a similar way but in different fields, relevant to separate but
            overlapping aspects of any person's everyday life. Which sphere of our human experience is relevant to which is really the main 
            differientiating factor between both, and how the relationship between these parts of ourselves and our surrounding reality works
            tells us to what extent we have been able to develop them.<br /><br />

            It would be easy to say that one is more important, better or stronger than the other, but we would be ignoring the fact that, 
            when both these skillsets work in harmony is when we see the best expression of human capacity being explored. Just as we need one
            hand to wash the other, emotions inform us about what we know and the thinking mind creates a conceptual framework for us to hold and 
            understand our emotions at an operational level. For those of us striving to find happiness in this birth, emotional intelligence 
            gives us tools to understand what it is we need in order to be happy, as well as helping others and being helped by others in this pursuit.
