      <p>
        Kia ora and welcome to this new technical blog post! <br />

        On this occasion we will be discussing some of the tools we have been learning and
        actively using in our journey to becoming Full Stack Web Developers.
        Make sure you bring a fan to help you cool you down as we manage our
        excitement through this quick recap of all we are learning!

      <h2>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        First things first, let us talk about the three main characters of our
        story this week, you know their names! It’s HTML (Hypertext Markup
        Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets, and JavaScript! The three
        ingredients for a delicious looking (and working) website. Delicious?
        Yes, DELICIOUS! And I’ll show you why with a simple example.<br /><br />

        I find Burgers to be the perfect food sent by the Gods to guide
        humanity towards a perfectly balanced and wholesome way of life, but
        apart from that, they are the best analogy to discuss the relationship
        between our languages in question. Ready?<br /><br />

        The main and most important element that we need in order to make a
        burger is, of course, the patty. It can be any type of meat, or blend
        of grains if you prefer, but every hamburger needs a juicy piece of
        something yum to earn its name. In our case, HTML provides all the
        basic elements a web page needs to exist; it gives the page its
        headers, titles, subheaders, paragraphs, images, links and anything
        else that actually makes up the page and its structure. When you know
        what type of page you are building, you know what you want your patty
        to be and you have arguably made the most important set of
        decisions.<br /><br />

        Once we have our preferences clear on our HTML patty we have to
        decide: what kind of presentation do I want it in? We are ready to
        choose our bun! Is it toasted, brioche, plain white bread or a piece
        of lettuce wrapped around the patty? CSS is the language that allows
        us to give our web-burger the look we want and configures it to give
        that look and feel that we are craving. CSS allows us to find the
        elements in our HTML document and say: you are going to look like
        this, with this and that colour, arranged this way in regards to size;
        it can even make our elements change depending on how we interact with
        them! So, much like a burger bun, it determines the way we perceive
        and handle our delicious website.<br /><br />

        Now, there are some things missing from our foodie image of
        perfection. Are we adding cheese, sriracha sauce, mustard? How will
        our taste buds interact with our personalised culinary web confection?
        JavaScript brings in all the variety we need to make our site have all
        the functions a modern-day portal needs. Do we need animations,
        cascading menus? Does our page transform as the user scrolls down,
        does it change colours? Do the buttons move around, jump or stand
        still? Is there a shopping cart or counter? If we think of our salad,
        toppings and sauces as ways of bringing out flavours or complimenting
        them to create a better, mouthwatering user experience, we can
        understand how JavaScript increases the enjoyability and fluidity of
        the user experience in our page. It can also work against our intended
        purpose for our portal, as we have all seen a friend just bathe their
        burger in one sauce or another (or worse, add pineapple to it!),
        making the whole thing taste like nothing but sauce. We can also
        sometimes be getting in our own way by adding functionalities that
        distract the user from being able to get what they want.<br /><br />

        Having used this scrumptious analogy to cement our understanding of
        our three languages, let us explore some elements within these
        languages that have been really useful to us in our work so far. What
        we will discuss from this point forward is mostly related to
        JavaScript and how we use its functionality as a language to achieve
        things we want on our page by using it to interact with our HTML and
        CSS components.<br /><br />
      </p>
      
      <h2>Flow Control and Loops</h2>
      <p>
        To get started, there are two very interesting and important
        components of JavaScript in its functioning as a programming language,
        these elements are present in other languages as well, and we will see
        why. We are talking about Control Flow and Loops.<br /><br />

        Regarding Control Flow, simply put, it is the way we can determine the
        order and whether or not something is executed in our code. It is
        mainly controlled by “if”, “else”, “switch”, “case” and “break”
        statements. This may seem a bit too abstract, so we can explore it by
        comparing it to an everyday experience. Say someone we love asks us to
        do something for them, in a very specific way to get a very specific
        result. I have a friend who bakes, and has told me how important it is
        in baking to mix the ingredients in the right order. So, let’s say she
        asked me to make a banana bread; I would have to:<br /><br />
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to the desired temperature.</li>
        <li>Measure the flour, baking soda and salt I need and put it in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Measure my butter and sugar and put them in a different bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix 2 eggs well and add them to my second bowl.</li>
        <li>Mash enough bananas to make my heart sing.</li>
        <li>Mix my bananas with my butter, eggs and sugar.</li>
        <li>Add the wet mix to the first bowl with all my dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix well with a spatula or my hands.</li>
        <li>Butter the baking tray.</li>
        <li>Pour the mix in the tray.</li>
        <li>Chuck that beast in the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake until ready.</li>
      </ol><br /><br />

      Doing all these things in the right order guarantees a delicious cake waiting for us at the end of the road. But
      what if I was cheating, and had a ready-made mix to just chuck in the tray and put straight in the oven? I would
      be skipping steps 2 to 8 and going straight from 1 to 9. And just like that, control flow allows for the processes
      we are programming in our code to go just as we want them to, allowing for exceptions and alternate rules to make
      sure it works in a variety of scenarios, and runs smoothly without any accidents. <br /><br />

      In the case of loops, we can imagine us now running a bakery, after finding that our true passion is delighting
      ourselves and others with sweet-smelling, tongue-melting, mind-shattering bites of flavour. Then, of course we
      would have to be repeating processes, like the ones described above, once and again to meet our customers'
      insatiable appetite for our confections. Which of our desserts and baked goods will we be making? How many of them
      and which days of the week? Will we restock everything every day or focus on the most popular items in our menu?
      Our loops are where we define how we navigate these processes and what are our responses to all these different
      cases.<br /><br />

      So let’s say we were in the kitchen, baking every morning from 5 am. We would have to:<br /><br />
      <ol>
        <li>Look at our current stock for each of the items in our menu.</li>
        <li>Compare stock numbers to our perceived demand for each of the items.</li>
        <li>Decide which items need to be restocked.</li>
        <li>Make sure we have all the ingredients to make them.</li>
        <li>Start production for each of the items.</li>
        <li>Put them out in our storefront for our guests to enjoy.</li>
        <li>Look again at our stock for each of the items in our menu.</li>
        <li>If the stock is running low on any item we go back to step 3 and repeat our process.</li>
        <li>If the stock is within our desired limits, the loop ends until the end of the day,<br /> when we take note
          of the
          stock to start over the next morning.</li>
      </ol><br /><br />

      Such, then, is the importance of having clear and working control flow and knowing how to properly use loops.<br />
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>The DOM</h2>
      <p>Now we have reached a very interesting, and sometimes confusing, bend in our road. The Document Object Model
        (DOM), with its imposing and serious name, is a programming interface that allows a user like ourselves to
        interact with the elements of an HTML or XML document. It represents the document in question, and its
        components in a format that looks like a hierarchy tree, transforming every element (a heading, a paragraph or a
        button) into a node in the tree. We can use this way of organising the elements in our document to interact with
        them and make changes to their styles, content or behaviour in response to user actions. And how do we achieve
        this? By using JavaScript, in our case, or other programming languages to dictate exactly how we want everything
        to behave.<br /><br />

        Say we want to have a collapsing menu that appears when we hover over it and its elements, but disappears once
        we move remove the mouse cursor from on top of it. We can use our visual coding interface (like VS Code) or even
        the browsers DevTools to script the behaviour we want, exactly like we want it. We can accomplish this by
        creating variables that represent our menu and its items, and the program these variables within a function to
        appear or disappear depending on an event (an user action) like ‘click’ or ‘hover’. We would write this code,
        link it to our .css and .html files, and so, have our dropdown menu work as desired.<br />
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>
      <p>Moving on to another very important pair, arrays and objects are variables within JavaScript that allow us to
        store, organise and access data in different ways. To start us off, arrays are collections of values organised
        in linear order, the order is registered in the array’s index and holds the information of which item goes in
        which position. When we want to access an item in an array, we use its position in the index to call upon it. So
        if I had [‘pear’, ‘tango’, 4665, True, ‘fandango’] as an array called “plumbus”, I could access ‘tango’ by
        stating, let’s say: “console.log(plumbus[1])”, remembering that we start counting the items in our arrays from 0
        and not from 1.<br /><br />

        Now, objects have a different way of storing information. Instead of using the number of an item’s position,
        keys (words or symbols selected by the programmer to hold a value) are paired with a value (numbers, strings of
        text or booleans) to store the information. So, in a case like storing user information, we would have an object
        called “userInfo” and it would hold keys like “age: 25, student: true, married: false, name: Jahhoondadongo”,
        and we would access the information held in the object by saying, for example :
        “console.log(userInfo.name)”.<br /><br />

        All in all, the main difference between the way we access the data in arrays and objects is that we use
        numerical index values for the first, and keys in the case of the second. Arrays are, then, best used to access
        data in a specific order, and objects are better for data that we access by calling a specific key or
        property.<br /><br /></p>
      <br />
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>And finally, our functions, the bread and butter of programming in JavaScript (and many other languages), are a
        piece of code that fulfils a purpose and can be used multiple times. They allow us to structure our code into
        contained and manageable chunks, so we can better write, read, organise and maintain it. We can say they help us
        reuse our code over and over, saving time and energy by building upon our previous work. They also isolate
        specific tasks, which we can test and debug individually making our jobs easier. Another way they help us is by
        avoiding code repetition, making our job more efficient and reducing the risk of creating bugs.<br /><br />

        I hope you kept your fan close by as we have taken this quick stroll around our coding tools and elements, if
        you enjoyed as much as I did, you sure would have been taking a couple of breaks to cool off and catch your
        breath.<br /><br />

        Read you again soon, don’t forget to hold on to that fan and keep it cool as we go.
