      <h1>display: inline vs display: inline-block</h1><br>
      <p>It seems that all the elements we work with in HTML are actually blocks, from our bigger elements, like head,
        body, footers, to the smaller ones like links and simple words in a paragraph.
        All of these elements have properties like margin, size, padding, height and width, and we manipulate these
        properties to make them work and look exactly like we want them to.
        But in order to successfully do so, we need to also take into account the way they are displayed.</p><br>
